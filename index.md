# The start of a new project
This blog will be a new project of mine. 
Here I will be posting writeups on my projects and other stuff.
Main goal is to improve written english, so please leave feedback if there is something I can improve upon!

## About me
I'm from Sweden and sometimes I like to make stuff. Especially things involving technology. Here is a list of my other interests:
- Rock climbing
- Programming
- Reading
- Jogging

My favourite food is probably tacos at the moment. I think it’s not unreasonable to eat tacos for every meal.  

### The end
Oh wow, that’s not a lot of information. Well stay tuned and I will come up with something more to post.
Hopefully a lot more interesting.
